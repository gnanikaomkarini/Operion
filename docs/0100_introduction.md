# 100: Introduction to Operion

## What is Operion?

Operion is a mode-driven, intelligent operating system layer designed to help you live a more focused and intentional digital life. It adapts your computer's environment based on your current intent, the time of day, and your behavior.

Unlike traditional operating systems that treat all tasks and applications equally, Operion introduces **system-wide modes**. These modes reshape your user interface, control which applications you can access, and use AI-powered insights to guide your behavior. The ultimate goal is to help you:

-   **Work deeply** without distractions.
-   **Rest intentionally** during breaks.
-   **Consume entertainment mindfully** and without guilt.

Operion is not a standalone operating system but a lightweight layer that runs on top of your existing OS (Linux, Windows, or macOS). This makes it a practical and extensible solution for enhancing your productivity and well-being.

## The Core Philosophy

Modern operating systems are built for machine performance, not for human focus. Operion flips the script by optimizing for:

-   **Focus without friction:** Creating an environment where doing the right thing is easy.
-   **Intentional mode switching:** Making conscious decisions about how you spend your time.
-   **Behavioral awareness:** Providing insights into your habits so you can improve them.
-   **Sustainable productivity:** Helping you work effectively without burning out.

> Operion doesn’t ask for more discipline. It designs a system where discipline isn't required.

This documentation will guide you through the core features and concepts of Operion.
