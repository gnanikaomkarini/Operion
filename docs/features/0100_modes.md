# 200: System-Wide Modes

## The Concept of Modes

The core of the Operion experience is **modes**. A mode is a system-wide state that defines the "rules of engagement" for how you interact with your computer at any given moment. Instead of having a single, static environment, Operion allows you to switch between different modes, each tailored to a specific intention.

Modes are manually controlled, allowing you to make a conscious decision about what you want to do. When you switch to a mode, Operion instantly changes several aspects of your digital environment.

Modes can affect:
-   **Application Visibility & Permissions:** Which apps are you allowed to open?
-   **UI Themes and Layouts:** The look and feel of your desktop.
-   **Notification Behavior:** Whether notifications are silenced or allowed.
-   **System Policies:** Other rules that govern your computer's behavior.

## The Default Modes

Operion comes with three pre-configured modes, each designed for a specific purpose.

### 🧑‍💻 Work Mode

Work Mode is designed for deep, focused work. When you enter Work Mode, Operion creates a distraction-free environment.

-   **App Restrictions:** Only applications on your pre-defined "work list" are accessible. All other applications are hidden or blocked.
-   **Minimalist UI:** The user interface shifts to a monochrome, minimal theme to reduce visual clutter and stimulation.
-   **Notifications Suppressed:** All system and application notifications are automatically silenced.
-   **Time-Locked Sessions:** You can lock yourself into Work Mode for a specific duration, making it harder to switch out impulsively.

### 😌 Chill Mode

Chill Mode is for light productivity, recovery, and relaxed activities. It's the perfect mode for winding down after a long work session or for a lazy weekend morning.

-   **Softer UI:** The UI theme changes to something more visually pleasant and less stark than Work Mode.
-   **Relaxed Restrictions:** You have access to a wider range of applications, such as music players, reading apps, and personal project tools.
-   **Reduced Notifications:** Only important notifications might be allowed through.

### 🎬 Entertainment Mode

Entertainment Mode is for intentional, guilt-free leisure. It acknowledges that relaxation and entertainment are important parts of a balanced life.

-   **Media-Centric UI:** The UI can be configured to prioritize media applications.
-   **No Productivity Penalties:** Time spent in this mode does not negatively affect your productivity scores.
-   **Full Access:** All applications and websites are typically available.

## Manual Mode Switching

In the initial version of Operion, you switch between modes manually via the Operion UI (e.g., a simple menu bar app). This is a deliberate design choice. The act of manually switching modes forces you to be intentional about how you are about to spend your time.
