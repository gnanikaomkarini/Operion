# 600: Insights & Analytics

## Actionable Insights, Not Just Raw Data

Operion doesn't just track your activity; it turns that data into **actionable insights** that help you understand your habits and improve your focus. The goal is to provide you with a clear picture of how you spend your time, without overwhelming you with raw statistics.

The insights are presented in a clean, easy-to-understand dashboard within the Operion UI.

## Daily Insights

At the end of each day, you can review a summary of your activity. This daily report helps you reflect on your day and identify what went well and what could be improved.

The Daily Insights include:

-   **Focus Score:** A percentage-based score that represents how much of your day was spent in "Work Mode" on productive tasks.
-   **Deep Work Duration:** The total amount of time you spent in uninterrupted blocks of focused work.
-   **Distraction Percentage:** The percentage of your time that was spent on applications or websites you've marked as distracting.
-   **Mode Usage Breakdown:** A chart showing how you divided your time between Work, Chill, and Entertainment modes.

### Example Daily Insight:

> “Your focus score today was 78%. You achieved 4.2 hours of deep work, but lost about an hour to social media sites in the afternoon.”

## Weekly Insights

The weekly report provides a higher-level view of your habits and trends over time. This helps you see the bigger picture and make strategic changes to your schedule and routines.

The Weekly Insights include:

-   **Productivity Trends:** Is your focus score generally increasing or decreasing?
-   **Peak Focus Hours:** The time of day when you are consistently most focused.
-   **Common Distraction Patterns:** What are your most frequent distractions? When are you most likely to get sidetracked?
-   **Suggested Schedule Improvements:** Based on your data, Operion might suggest changes to your routine.

### Example Weekly Insight:

> “Your focus drops most often between 3–4 PM. Consider scheduling lighter tasks or taking a break during this window.”

## The Purpose of Analytics

The analytics in Operion are designed to be a tool for self-reflection and improvement, not a tool for self-judgment. They help you answer questions like:

-   Am I spending my time in a way that aligns with my goals?
-   What are the biggest obstacles to my focus?
-   When am I most productive?

By providing clear, data-driven answers to these questions, Operion empowers you to take control of your digital life.
