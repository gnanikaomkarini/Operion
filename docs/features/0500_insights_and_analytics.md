# 600: Insights & Analytics

## Actionable Insights, Not Just Raw Data

Operion doesn't just track your activity; it turns that data into **actionable insights** that help you understand your habits and improve your focus. The goal is to provide you with a clear picture of how you spend your time, without overwhelming you with raw statistics.

The insights are delivered through two channels:

1.  **Native Notifications (Summaries):** Daily summaries appear as non-intrusive notifications to keep you informed without breaking your flow.
2.  **Operion Dashboard (Deep Dives):** For detailed weekly reports, charts, and historical trends, you can open the dedicated Operion Dashboard application. This separates the consumption of heavy data from your day-to-day workflow.

## Daily Insights

At the end of each day, you can review a summary of your activity. This daily report helps you reflect on your day and identify what went well and what could be improved.

The Daily Insights include:

-   **Focus Score:** A percentage-based score that represents how much of your day was spent in "Work Mode" on productive tasks.
-   **Deep Work Duration:** The total amount of time you spent in uninterrupted blocks of focused work.
-   **Distraction Percentage:** The percentage of your time that was spent on applications or websites you've marked as distracting.
-   **Mode Usage Breakdown:** A chart showing how you divided your time between Work, Chill, and Entertainment modes.

### Example Daily Insight:

> “Your focus score today was 78%. You achieved 4.2 hours of deep work, but lost about an hour to social media sites in the afternoon.”

## Weekly Insights

The weekly report provides a higher-level view of your habits and trends over time. This helps you see the bigger picture and make strategic changes to your schedule and routines.

The Weekly Insights include:

-   **Productivity Trends:** Is your focus score generally increasing or decreasing?
-   **Peak Focus Hours:** The time of day when you are consistently most focused.
-   **Common Distraction Patterns:** What are your most frequent distractions? When are you most likely to get sidetracked?
-   **Suggested Schedule Improvements:** Based on your data, Operion might suggest changes to your routine.

### Example Weekly Insight:

> “Your focus drops most often between 3–4 PM. Consider scheduling lighter tasks or taking a break during this window.”

## The Purpose of Analytics

The analytics in Operion are designed to be a tool for self-reflection and improvement, not a tool for self-judgment. They help you answer questions like:

-   Am I spending my time in a way that aligns with my goals?
-   What are the biggest obstacles to my focus?
-   When am I most productive?

By providing clear, data-driven answers to these questions, Operion empowers you to take control of your digital life.

## Advanced Analytics & Reporting (Future Goal)

To move beyond simple summaries and empower deep self-analysis, the analytics component could be enhanced with more powerful, interactive tools.

1.  **Custom Date Range Filtering:** Allow users to view and analyze their focus data for any custom date range, not just the current day or week.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** The AI Insight Engine could proactively identify relationships in a user's habits, such as, "Your focus score is 15% higher on days when you start with a Focus Sprint."
3.  **Data Export:** Give users the ability to export their raw, anonymized activity data in formats like CSV or JSON, allowing for analysis in external tools and reinforcing the principle of data ownership.
4.  **"Distraction Score" Learning:** Over time, Operion could learn a nuanced "distraction score" for different applications and websites based on a user's patterns, leading to more accurate focus metrics.
