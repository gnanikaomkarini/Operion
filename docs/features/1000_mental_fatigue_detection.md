# 1100: Mental Fatigue Detection (Advanced)

## A Proactive Approach to Sustainable Productivity

One of the most ambitious and forward-looking goals for Operion is to help users not just work more, but work *smarter* and more *sustainably*. A key part of this is preventing burnout. The **Mental Fatigue Detection** feature is designed to do just that.

This advanced feature would aim to detect the early signs of mental fatigue and proactively suggest that the user take a break, *before* their productivity and well-being begin to suffer.

## Potential Signals of Fatigue

This is a complex problem that would require analyzing a variety of subtle signals from your computer usage. The system would **not** use a webcam or microphone. Instead, it would look for changes in your interaction patterns.

Potential signals could include:

-   **Increased Typing Errors:** A higher frequency of backspace or delete key presses.
-   **More Frequent Task Switching:** Rapidly switching between applications without spending significant time in any of them.
-   **Decreased Typing or Mouse Speed:** A subtle slowing down of your interaction speed.
-   **Inconsistent Work Patterns:** An increase in short pauses or micro-breaks.
-   **Time of Day and Duration of Work:** The model would learn that you are more likely to be fatigued after 3 hours of continuous work or late at night.

## How It Would Work

1.  **Baseline Measurement:** Operion would first establish a baseline for your normal working patterns over a period of several days.
2.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** The system would then monitor your activity in real-time, looking for deviations from your established baseline.
3.  **Proactive Suggestions:** When the system detects a cluster of fatigue signals, it would generate a gentle, non-intrusive notification.

### Example Suggestion:

> “You've been working intensely for over 2 hours, and it looks like your focus is starting to fade.
>
> This would be a great time for a 10-minute break. Why not switch to Chill Mode and listen to some music?”

## Research and Development

This is a highly experimental feature that would require significant research and development. It is considered a "Phase 2" or even "Phase 3" feature for the project.

-   **Data Science:** It would involve building and training a sophisticated local machine learning model to detect these subtle patterns.
-   **User Studies:** It would be crucial to test this feature with real users to ensure that it is accurate, helpful, and not annoying.

The ultimate vision for this feature is to create a system that not only manages your focus but also looks out for your long-term well-being, helping you build a healthier and more sustainable relationship with your work.
