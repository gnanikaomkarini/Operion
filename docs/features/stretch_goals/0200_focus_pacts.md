# 0200: Focus Pacts (Social Accountability)

## The Concept

Operion is primarily a tool for personal focus, but accountability can be a powerful motivator. The "Focus Pacts" feature would introduce an optional social layer, allowing users to share their focus intentions with a small, private group of friends or colleagues to create mutual accountability and support.

## How It Could Work

The entire feature would be designed with privacy and minimalism as top priorities.

1.  **Strictly Opt-In:** This feature would be disabled by default. Users would need to actively enable it and send explicit invitations to connect with others.
2.  **Private Connections:** A user could send a connection request to another Operion user. A connection is only formed if both parties consent.
3.  **Sharing a Focus Session:** When starting a `Work Mode` session or a `Focus Sprint`, the user would have a clear option to "Share this session" with one or more of their connections. This action would always be voluntary for each session.
4.  **Minimalist Notifications:** A connected friend would receive a single, non-intrusive notification in their Operion UI, such as: *"Alex has started a 90-minute Focus Sprint."*
5.  **No Detailed Tracking:** To guarantee privacy, the feature would **never** share what apps or websites are being used. It would only share the existence and planned duration of a user-initiated focus session.
6.  **Shared Status (Optional):** The UI could display a simple, abstract status indicator (e.g., a colored dot) next to a friend's name, indicating they are currently in an active, shared focus session. This would serve as a subtle "do not disturb" signal.

## Benefits

-   **Positive Motivation:** Leveraging the psychological principle that sharing a goal increases the likelihood of achieving it.
-   **Team Coordination:** For small teams, it offers a lightweight way to signal periods of deep work, reducing interruptions and respecting team members' focus.
-   **Community & Support:** Fosters a sense of shared purpose among users who are all working towards better focus and productivity.
